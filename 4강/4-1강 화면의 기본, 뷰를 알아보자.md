lets talk about view.

뷰에 대해서 이야기 해보자.

The view is that rectangular area, as I said. It defines a coordinate space, okay?

말했듯이, 뷰는 사각형 영역이야. 뷰는 좌표 공간으로 정의해.

So, any time you’re drawing or handing input, or whatever, you need a coordinate space to be defined for you.

언제든지 드로잉과 입력 처리 또는 무엇이든지, 정의된 좌표공간이 필요해. 

And, use that space to draw and to handle touch event’s.

그리고 그 공간은 그리기나 터치이벤트를 처리하는데 사용되지.

This kind of view setup is hierarchical, as you might imagine, so, you can imagine that you have some view, like maybe this is the view that contains your entire UI for an MVC.

 이러한 종류의 뷰는 위계구조를 가지고 있어서, 니가 상상을 해본다면 이게 하나의 MVC를 위한 전체 UI를 포함한 뷰라고 할 수 있지.     

And then, you’ve got some sub views maybe they’re buttons, or whatever, and they might be inside a view, like let’s say a stack view or something like that.

And, maybe those are in another view, okay?

So, you can see how these things are hierarchical, right?

You’re building your views in a hierarchy, a view hierarchy we call it, okay? 

Now, these views can overlap, obviously.

And, they also, even if you have a view inside a view, so a view, let’s say in this view right here, if you had another view inside it, it could actually extend outside the bounds of its parent, that’s legal. 

And, you can set a switch in the view whether it’s going to clip, and only show this part, or whether it’ll allow this thing to draw outside of its parent, okay?

So, that’s how we build our user interface, is by kinda grouping these things together.

You’re totally familiar with that in the calculator. 

And, when you build something like this, every view ends up having a single super view, right?

That’s the view that it’s inside.

And, any given view could have any number of sub-views, okay?

Like the stack views could have any number of things stacked inside of whatever.

The sub-views, you can find them for a view by looking at this VAR, the CUI view VAR called sub-views.

You see it’s an array of UI view there, and, we’ll talk a little later about the order of those sub-views matters.

And that’s it basically, okay?

That’s how we represent this new hierarchy.

There is a UI window in iOS, but it almost  doesn’t matter, okay?

You’re never gonna interact with it.

There’s always only one, per app.

Actually, you could have more than one if you had like an external screen, okay?

Like you were doing, what do we call, the, the screen cast, it’s not coming to me, where you can, have a second screen.

I can’t think of it but, like on Apple TV, you could have a second screen for your device.

Whatever so then you might have two UI windows, but it wouldn’t matter cuz you’re almost never gonna create one or send a message to one or whatever.

So, it’s all about views, it’s all about this view hierarchy that we’re gonna build okay, in iOS.

It’s unlike on the Mac, where of course the Mac you’ve got windows, right, separate windows.

You don’t really have that, in iOS, not enough room really to do that,

This hierarchy is most often constructed inn Xcode graphically.

Like you did with the calculator, okay?

But, you can build this hierarchy in code.

The two methods are add subview, and remove from super view, that’s putting them in and taking them out.

Notice that add subview is sent to the future super view of the view saying, hey, or add this sub view to yourself.

Remove from subview is actually sent to the view you want to remove, okay?

So, remove from subview from super view rather is kind of like remove yourself from your super view, okay?

Where dose the view hierarchy start?

It starts right at the top, in that MVC that we see in the storyboard, there’s a view that fills that whole space.

There is a pointer from your view controller to that top level veiw, okay?

That pointer is called view.

So, if you look at view controller, right, everyone knows what view controller is?

That’s where you put a lot of your code in the calculator, right?

Where you wired up all your outlets and actions.

That class, view Controller has a var called view.

You havent’ used it you.

But, it is a pointer to the top level UI View.

Okay, and that’s an important view to have a pointer to because you’re gonna be adding subviews to it, etcetera, especially if you’re doing it programmatically.

You really need this var so you can call add subciew on it and put some things in there.

And, this view is automatically hooked up for you, in your storyboard.

So, you don’t have to do anything.

It’s just automatically hooke up okay?

And, this top level view is the view whose bounds will change, for example, when you rotate your device, right?

The bounds go from being tall and thin, to being short and wide, okay?

That’s the bounds of this top level view.

Now, when you change the bounds of this top over view, if you have constrains, like if you put it in the calculator where we tied the stack view to the edges?

When those edges change, of course, the stack view gets pulled around and strectched.
And, the stack view knows how to resize and distribute the things inside of it.

That’s part of what the stack view does.

Thats’ pretty much all it does actually.

So that’s why rotating, changing the bounds of this top view cause a riplle effect where everything re-positings inside, okay?

Now, let’s talk a little bit about initializing a UI View, okay?

As always we want to try to aviod doing an initializer if we can just get away with just saying equals whatever, but if you have to have an initalizer because you just feel like you just can’t initialize a VAR somehow else.

Then you have to be careful with UIView because it actually has two important initalizer, okay?

One of them is required, that’s the second one, init with coder.

That init is the init that’s used to create the UIView when it’s coming out of a storyboard, okay?

So, if you built this view by dragging it out into your storyboard, when the stroyboard gets reconstituted at run time, then this is the init that’s gonna get controlled, init with coder.

The init with frame, that’s the init that you’re going to call if you create a view in code, okay?

And that frame that you’re doing, specifying is the frame of this view in its super view, in other words where it’s going to be, where this view is going to be.

And, it is legal to, to just do init with no arguments.

That’s gonna essentially be ZeroRect.

You’re just gonna put it, like, up here in the left-hand corner really, really small.

You can set a frame later to move it.

Anyway, since you have two of these things, and one of them is required, the second one, you’re gonna end yo implementing both, okay?

Because you’re gonna want your view to be able to work from storyboards or you want people to be able to, you know, instantiate them from code, okay?

So, I recommend putting, all your initialization code in something like a set up function here. 

And then, override both of these two and  call set up from both of them.

That way they’ll both be doing exactly the same set up, right?
Make sense, kinda obvious.

But, I just wanna make sure you know you gotta do both of these.

All right, another initialization mechanism that  you can do for UI view, but only works for views coming out of storyboards, is to put your code in this method awakeFromNib().

Okay, awakFromNib() is actually called on any object that comes out of a storyboard, okay?

But, not called at all in you call an object in code.

And, so, you can, you know, put same kind of set up stuff that you would put in the other one as long as you’re fine with your view only working when it’s coming from a storyboard, okay?

All right. So, now let’s talk about the drawing. 
맞아, 이제 드로잉에 대해 이야기 알아보자.
Okay, I’ve got this UI view and I wanna draw. Well, before I can show you how to draw, you know, draw something inside of these Your custom view, and I need to talk about some types, some data types, okay, the first one here is CG float. 

So, we don’t use doubles or float, I haven’t really talked about the float struct in Swift. but it’s just like double. It’s just, float is single precision, and double is double precisions, that’s why it’s called a double.

But we don’t use floats or doubles when we’re drawing, we use this special struct called CGFloat, okay?

And that means that sometimes, you’re going to be doing calculations in doubles and then you’re gonna want to draw, with the result you’re gonna have to convert it to a CGFloat.

By doing CGFloat called as initializer, there’s an initializer for CGFloat that takes a double luckily and the other takes a float, okay?

So always using CGFloats and you’ll run into some trouble here and there, because you’re trying to pass doubles into API that takes CGFloats, cuz it’s drawing API, okay?

There’s a couple of other obvious structs. 

There’s CGPoint that just has two bars in it, one is the x, and one is the y, tight?

That represents a point and then a CGSize, same thing a struct with two things, a width and a height. 

Okay, those are easy.

Then there’s CGRect.

CGRect gets it’s own slide because even though it’s obvious, it has an origin which is a CGPoint and a size which is a size, right, it’s a rectangle, has an origin and a size.

It also has a lot of methods on it, okay?

Cool methods you can use or vars and methods like finding the minimum x value of this rectangle or the mid y point of this thing or even intersect this with another rectangle and give me the intersecting part like this slashed area here, okay?

Or this one intersects which says does this rect intersect this other rect.

You can imagine there are a couple of dozen of these kinds of utility methods.

So you want to definitely get to know them so you don’t end up writing these methods yourself when you want to intersect two rects or whatever, okay?

So those are the main types that we are going to use when we draw.

So you’re gonna be familiar with those types.

All right, let’s talk about the coordinate system we’re gonna draw in in our view, okay?

The origin is in the upper left, upper left, okay.

It’s not lower left like Cartesian coordinates or like the Mac okay, when you draw on the Mac, if you’re building a Mac app, it’s in the upper left.

That means increasing y means you’re moving down the screen, okay.
y 증가는 스크린 아래로 움직인다는 뜻이야.

So if you look at this point I created up here, 500 35, notice it’s 500 over in x, but only down in y.

That’s why it’s way over on that side there, okay.

The points that we are talking about here in drawing when I mention all of this, or the unit if you will are called points, okay.

Now a point is not a pixel.
자, 포인트는 픽셀이 아니야. 
Some iOS devices are extremely high resolution like the iPhone Plus, the iPhone6 Plus, very very high resolution.
아이폰 플러스나 아이폰 6플러스 같은 iOS 디바이스들은 극단적으로 높은 해상도를 가지고 있어. 매우매우 높은 해상도지. 
It has three pixel per point, okay.
포인트당 3픽셀을 가지고 있어. 
Some of the other devices have two pixel per point, 
다른 디바이스중 어떤건 포인트당 2픽셀을 가져.
Usually, you don’t care too much about the pixels.
보통, 픽셀에 대해서 너무 많이 신경쓰지 않아도 돼.
If you have a lot of pixels, it just means the lines that you draw are gonna look really smooth or the image that you have are gonna be really detailed.
만약 많은 픽셀을 가지고 있다면, 매우 부드러워 보이는 선 혹은 매우 자세하게 된 이미지를 뜻하지.
You are gonna be able to use a lot of image data to draw them, okay?
많은 이미지 데이터를 그것들을 그리기 위해 사용할 수 있을거야. 
But if you do care, and actually in assignment three, you are gonna care, so pay attention.

If you do care, you can find out by asking a UIView what is your content scale factor?
만약 신경쓴다면, content scale factor가 무엇인지 UIView 물음으로 부터 찾아낼 수 있지.
That’s basically how many pixels per point okay.
저건 기본적으로  포인트당 얼마나 많은 픽셀이 있는지에 대한거야. 
The boundaries where you draw in, so this is super important and this is where a lot of confusion comes in, that’s why I spend a lot of time in this even though it’s very simple but people just get these things messed up.

Let’s talk about the rectangle in which you draw, okay, cuz you’re gonna draw inside a rectangle.
정사각형에 대해서 이야기해보자. 정사각형 안에 그릴꺼니까.

When you are drawing, you’re using this var in your UI view.
그릴때, UI View 안에 이 변수를 이용할 거야. 
It’s called bounds.
bounds라고 불려.
It’s a CGRect.
이건 CGRect이고. 
That is the rectangle in which you’re drawing in your own coordinate system, in the coordinates system your’e drawing in okay.

So any time you’re writing drawing code, you’re using this okay?
드로잉 코드를 쓰고있을 때, 이것을 이용해야해. 

There’s another thing called frame, which is also CGRect, which people confuse between these two. 

But frame is completely different.
frame 은 완전히 다른거야.

It has a completely different purpose, and it’s in a completely different coordinate system.
frame은 완전히 다른 제안(?)을 가지고 있고 완전히 다른 좌표 시스템이야.

Okay, so if try to use frame instead of bounds, it might work in certain circumstances but then be messed up on others.


So what’s frame about?

Frame is about where you view is in it’s super view?

Frame is rectangle, a CGRect that completely encloses you in your super views, coordinate system.

Okay, so when I wanna put some view somewhere, I have to specify where in it’s SuperView it goes.

I do that by specifying it’s frame.

And of course, since I’m talking about putting it into SuperView, that’s in the SuperView’s coordinate system,  not in the drawing, coordinate system on the inside there, okay?

Similarly, center, a lot of people think, oh great, that’s the center of my view.

But it’s not okay?

That’s the center of your view in your SuperViews coordinate system.

So that’s positioning you, okay?

Frame and center are positioning you.

They have nothing to do with your drawing.

When you’re drawing, you’re using your bounds, okay?
그리고 있을때, bounds를 이용해야해.

So I do not want to see you using frame inside your drawing code, or centre.

Got it?
이해하겠니?

And I’ll emphasize this again in the demo.

All right, so one thing about frame and center, you might think that size and width are going to be the same for the frame and centre, but they’re not because views can be rotated.

If you had a rotated view like view B, okay, it’s bounds is 200 wide by 250 high you see that,

but look at this frame 320 by 320 why?

Because this is the smallest rectangle in the super views coordinate system that will completely contain this rotated view, okay?

So the width and height are not the same, okay?

This is the frame 320 by 320, this is the bounds.

When you’re drawing in B, you don’t even know you’re rotated, so you want to make sure that you’re using this coordinates system right here, bounds, okay?
